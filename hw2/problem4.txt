a)
	A set of strings, each corresponding to one word found on the webpage, should be used. 
	Since the presence of the word at least once on the webpage is the data that needs to be
	stored, a set would work best as there would be no repeats in data or need to store other
	pieces of data.
b) 
	A map of strings for each students name and a corresponding list of strings telling each class the student is
	enrolled in would be best. This would make looking up a student and seeing what classes the student is enrolled
	in simple, as each student only exists once and the classes can be in many different student's corresponding
	"class lists."
c)
	An array of strings, each containing one countries name in the order they will march, would be best 
	for this situation as a predetermined number of countries will be in this set, allowing for an array
	of the correct size to be allocated. An array has order that will show the order the countries will
	march in.
